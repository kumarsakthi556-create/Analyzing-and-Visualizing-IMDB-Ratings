# Analyzing-and-Visualizing-IMDB-Ratings
This project explores a dataset of movie ratings (such as MovieLens) to uncover insights into user preferences, rating patterns, and popular movies. Using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn/Matplotlib, the analysis focuses on cleaning the data, summarizing key statistics, and creating visualizations that highlight meaningful trends.

1. **Key Steps:**
# Data Preparation
# Loaded movie ratings and metadata (movie titles, genres).
# Checked for missing values and ensured consistent formatting.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Examined distribution of ratings across users and movies.
# Calculated average rating and rating counts per movie.
# Identified biases, such as many users rating only a few movies.

2. **Visualization:**
# Histogram of rating distribution (to show user rating tendencies).
# Bar charts of top-rated movies (filtered by a minimum number of ratings for reliability).
# Time-series analysis of rating trends over years.

3. **Insights:**
# Most ratings cluster around positive values (e.g., 3.0â€“4.0).
# Popular movies receive thousands of ratings, while many films have very few.
# Some genres consistently receive higher ratings than others.

4. **Tools & Skills Used:**
# Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
# Data Cleaning, EDA, and Visualization
# Storytelling with Data to highlight trends and patterns
